    Make sure to comment down below any counters or tech/tips that you have for any Jujutsu Shenanigans character that I didn't end up mentioning in the video!
    
    In this video, I'm going to be showcasing how to COUNTER EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER, even Mahoraga! You might have not known all these counters, so I hope these help you out! These characters are Gojo (Honored One), Itadori (Vessel), Hakari (Restless Gambler), Megumi, (Ten Shadows), Mahoraga (Mahoraga), and lastly, Mahito, (Perfection!) This content is very similar to my "5+ TIPS for EVERY CHARACTER in Jujutsu Shenanigans" where I talk about tips for every character in Jujutsu Shenanigans, but in this video, I tell you how to counter them!
    This video is meant for people who enjoyed and learned from my commentary videos like  TIPS for EVERY CHARACTER in Jujutsu Shenanigans, my helpful guides like  Megumi Tips You Didn Know In Jujutsu Shenanigans and content like my  in Jujutsu Shenanigans... video.
    This isnt a Mahito leak or a Jujutsu Shenanigans update video, a Mahito ultimate update or Achievements in Jujutsu Shenanigans, or anything like that, but its a video that showcases multiple tips that you probably didnt know on how to counter your least favorite Jujutsu Shenanigans character!
